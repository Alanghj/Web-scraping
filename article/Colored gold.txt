Pure gold is slightly reddish yellow in colour, but coloured gold in various other colours can be produced.
Coloured golds can be classified in three groups:
Alloys with silver and copper in various proportions, producing white, yellow, green and red golds. These are typically malleable alloys.
Intermetallic compounds, producing blue and purple golds, as well as other colours. These are typically brittle, but can be used as gems and inlays.
Surface treatments, such as oxide layers.Pure 100% (in practice, 99.9% or better) gold is 24 karat by definition, so all coloured golds are less pure than this, commonly 18K (75%), 14K (58.5%), 10K (41.6%), or 9K (37.5%).

=== White gold ===

White gold is usually an alloy containing about 75% gold and about 25% nickel and zinc.
White gold is an alloy of gold and at least one white metal (usually nickel, silver, or palladium). Like yellow gold, the purity of white gold is given in karats.
White gold's properties vary depending on the metals used and their proportions.
