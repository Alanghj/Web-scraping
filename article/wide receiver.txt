A wide receiver (WR), also referred to as a wideout, formerly a split end, is an eligible receiver in gridiron football. A key skill position of the offense, it gets its name from the player being split out "wide" (near the sidelines), farthest away from the rest of the offensive formation.
A forward pass-catching specialist, the wide receiver is one of the fastest players on the field alongside cornerbacks and running backs. One on either extreme of the line is typical, but several may be employed on the same play.
Through 2019 only two wide receivers, Jerry Rice (in 1987 and 1993) and Michael Thomas (in 2019) have won Offensive Player of the Year.  In every other year it was awarded to either a quarterback or running back. No wide receiver has ever won MVP. Jerry Rice is the leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns in the all-time list for receivers along with being a 3-time SB champion and 10-time All-Pro selections.


== Role ==

The wide receiver's principal role is to catch forward passes from the quarterback. On passing plays, the receiver attempts to avoid, outmaneuver, or simply outrun the cornerbacks or safeties typically defending him.  If the receiver becomes open on his pass route, the quarterback may throw a pass to him.
